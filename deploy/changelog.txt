HTTPTAPI README

v. 1.11
---------
- ConnectWise CRM does lineMakeCall, TSPI_lineDrop, lineMakeCall, TSPI_lineDrop ... without TSPI_lineCloseCall.
  Therefore I reset pLine->htCall already during TSPI_lineDrop (and not only during TSPI_lineCloseCall) to allow subsequent
  lineMakeCall.

v. 1.10
---------
- terminate log messages with \r\n
- added new response code mapping
  * 500: Internal Server Error: LINEDISCONNECTMODE_OUTOFORDER
//  * 401: Access Denied: LINEDISCONNECTMODE_DESTINATIONBARRED
TODO: Add new mappings to Word document

v. 1.9
---------
- allow basic/digest authentication: username/password must be specified in the URL
  e.g.: https://user:pass@example.com/dial....
- disable TEST-URI field as this is not implemented yet.

v. 1.8
---------
- follow HTTP 3xx redirection, max 20 times.

v. 1.6
---------
- add # as allowed dialstring character. This leads to following allowed characters:
  0123456789+*#
- URL-encode the dialed number

v. 1.5
---------
- internal release

v. 1.4
---------
- HTTPS: allow to use certificates from the Windows certificate store (uses a temp-file. TODO: load directly into memory)

v. 1.3

v. 1.2
---------
- fixed issues with Outlook (implemented TSPI_lineSetStatusMessages)

v. 1.1
---------
- fixed issues with Windows 7
- storage of HTTPTAPI settings moved from Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IPCOM\HttpTapi to 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Telephony\HTTPTAPI
- more error messages
